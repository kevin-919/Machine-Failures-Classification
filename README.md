# Binary Classification of Machine Failures
This repository contains a machine learning model for binary classification of machine failures. The model was trained on a dataset of machine failure data and achieved a 99% accuracy.

## Getting Started
To install and run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Run the main.py file.

## Model Description
The model was built using a neural network. The neural network has 12 layers, with each layer having 128 neurons. The activation function used for each layer is ReLU. Dropout was used after each layer to prevent overfitting.
The model was evaluated on a holdout dataset of machine failure data that was not used to train the model. The model achieved a 99% accuracy on the holdout dataset, which indicates that it is a well-trained model that can be used to predict machine failures with a high degree of accuracy.
